I took an C++ course on Udemy. Some of the simple homeworks for the course i have done are here.
I have not work on C++ before this course. So, these examples are beginning level. 
Here is the course info : https://havelsan.udemy.com/course/beginning-c-plus-plus-programming/learn/lecture/16442250#overview
